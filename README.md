I guess this makes me a nerd.

Credit goes to @emorikawa for convincing me to use Vim and setting me on the path that has led to this (dark?) place, as well as for letting me blatantly copy his beautiful scripts. For a better version of this repo, check out https://github.com/emorikawa/dotfiles/.

To make your vim not awful with minimum effort: `wget vim.dakotanelson.com | sh`
